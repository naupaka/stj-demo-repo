The goal of this report is to analyze some of the data in the gapminder global health dataset using `ggplot2`.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
gap.data.in <- read.delim("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", header=TRUE,sep="\t")
```

First we'll do some summary statistics on the dataset.

```{r}
summary(gap.data.in)
```

Next we would like to do three things:

1. Write this list
2. Do some stats
3. Make it look good

We could also do them in any order:

* This is one way
* Here is another
